# Final Project Outline

## Title
Differential Gene Expression in Liver and Intraheptic Bile Duct Cancers comparing Male and Female. 

## Author

## Overview of project
I will identify differentially expressed genes for Liver and Intraheptic Bile Duct Cancers between Male and Female. My analysis will utilize the DeSEQ2 package. For this analysis, I'll use the TCGA-LIHC cohort and have identified more than 300 Male samples and more than 150 Female samples. From my analysis, I hope to find out if there is a difference between the abundance of Liver and Intraheptic Bile Duct Cancers in Male v/s Female and if alcohol has an effect on the same. 

## Data
I will use the data from [https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/repository](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/repository). Examining clinical data, there are 388 tumor samples, and 121 are defined by me as light smokers and 271 are identified as heavy smokers. The specific files are available are here [redacted].


## Milestone 1
I will perform a first analysis of my data to ensure that it has the co-variants for me to explore. This will happen by November 22, 2022 end of day. My enture project will not be finished by then, but my final project will include everything (from beginnning to the end). 

## Milestone 2
My entire data will be loaded into vignette(through htseq), for seeking feedback. I will perform a deeper analysis of my data and my entire data will be loaded into vignette(through htseq), for seeking feedback. This will happen by November 29, 2022 end of day. My enture project will not be finished by then, but my final project will include everything (from beginnning to the end). 

## Deliverable
My final project which is due on December 3, 2022 will include a complete repository with clear documentation and description of your analysis and results.
